    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h3>A Platform Built for Tailors — and for Those Who Still Love Tailoring</h3>

    <p>
      In a world ruled by readymade fashion, it’s easy to forget the comfort and charm of custom-stitched clothing. Yet, many people still cherish their old outfits — not just for the fit, but for the feeling they bring. Whether it's a kurta stitched perfectly years ago or a pair of trousers no brand can match — these clothes are more than fabric. They are comfort, memory, and identity.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other side are thousands of skilled tailors — men and women who know the art of stitching but lack a modern platform to connect with customers. They wait, hoping someone will walk by or refer them. That gap is what this platform is here to fill.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Our mission is simple:</strong> to give talented tailors the digital space they deserve, and to help people find trustworthy tailoring services for clothes that truly matter.
